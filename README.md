# The script (TFanalysis) is used for time frequency analysis on EEG data that have been preprocessed with NetStation (EGI) and formatted with EP Toolkit (developed by Joseph Dien)
# You will need Matlab, EEGLAB, Fieldtrip to run the script
# because of the new NetStation plugin, switching between NetStation and EEGLAB can be very easy now
